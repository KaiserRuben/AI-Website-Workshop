# Workshop Management System - Feature Ideas

## Overview

This document outlines potential features and usage scenarios for expanding the workshop system from a single-event tool to a comprehensive workshop platform.

## Usage Contexts & Scenarios

### Educational Institution Scenarios

#### Multi-Class Management
- **Computer Science Professor** runs 3 different classes per semester
- **Workshop per class**: "CS101-Fall2024", "WebDev-Advanced", "AI-Workshop"
- **Student isolation**: Class A students can't see Class B projects
- **Gradual rollout**: Start workshop for one class, others join later

#### Recurring Sessions
- **Weekly coding labs** - new workshop each week
- **Semester progression** - build complexity over multiple workshops
- **Assessment periods** - archive completed workshops for grading

### Corporate Training Scenarios

#### Department-Based Workshops
- **Marketing team** learns basic web dev (beginner templates)
- **Engineering team** explores AI integration (advanced features)
- **Executive briefing** (view-only access to showcase capabilities)

#### Multi-Day Conferences
- **Day 1**: Intro workshop for beginners
- **Day 2**: Advanced workshop building on Day 1
- **Cross-pollination**: Allow experienced participants to mentor across workshops

### Community & Event Scenarios

#### Hackathons
- **Multiple tracks**: Frontend, Backend, AI/ML workshops running parallel
- **Team formation**: Move users between workshops as teams form
- **Judging phase**: Archive active workshops, create read-only galleries

#### Meetups & User Groups
- **Monthly events** with different themes
- **Skill-level segmentation**: Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced parallel workshops
- **Showcase mode**: Previous workshop galleries as inspiration

## Key Workshop Management Features

### 1. Multi-Workshop Management

```
Admin Dashboard:
├── Active Workshops (live sessions)
├── Scheduled Workshops (future)
├── Archived Workshops (completed)
└── Template Library (starting points)
```

**Features:**
- Create multiple workshops simultaneously
- Switch between workshop contexts
- Monitor all workshops from central dashboard
- Bulk operations (archive all, export all)

### 2. Workshop Lifecycle Control

#### Pre-workshop
- Setup wizard with templates
- Participant pre-registration
- Cost limit configuration
- Workshop settings (public/private, max participants)

#### During workshop
- Live management dashboard
- Real-time monitoring (costs, activity, progress)
- Emergency controls (pause AI, limit features)
- Moderator tools (remove participants, reset projects)

#### Post-workshop
- Automatic archiving
- Export participant work
- Generate usage reports
- Create showcase galleries

### 3. Participant Flow Management

#### Workshop Discovery
- Browse available workshops
- Filter by skill level, topic, time
- Preview workshop content and goals
- See participant count and activity level

#### Permission Systems
- **Open enrollment**: Anyone can join
- **Invite-only**: Requires admin approval
- **Code-based**: Join with workshop code
- **Timed access**: Automatic open/close times

#### Role Management
- **Participants**: Standard workshop access
- **Mentors**: Can help across multiple projects
- **Co-facilitators**: Limited admin rights
- **Observers**: View-only access (for executives, parents)

#### Cross-workshop Movement
- Experienced users help in multiple sessions
- Mentorship programs across skill levels
- Project collaboration between workshops

### 4. Template & Content Management

#### Starting Templates
- **Beginner**: Basic HTML structure with guided comments
- **Intermediate**: CSS frameworks and interactive elements
- **Advanced**: JavaScript projects and API integration
- **Themed**: Holiday pages, portfolio sites, game interfaces

#### Code Libraries
- Reusable components across workshops
- Community-contributed snippets
- Workshop-specific asset collections
- Version-controlled template updates

#### Workshop Themes
- **Frontend Focus**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **AI Integration**: Working with AI APIs
- **Game Development**: Interactive web games
- **Business Sites**: Professional portfolio creation
- **Creative Coding**: Artistic and experimental projects

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Multi-Workshop Foundation
**Goal**: Support multiple simultaneous workshops without breaking current functionality

**Features:**
- Create/archive workshops without disrupting active sessions
- Workshop discovery page for participants
- Basic workshop settings (name, description, max participants)
- Multi-workshop admin dashboard
- Workshop-specific cost tracking

**Technical Changes:**
- Update authentication to handle multiple active workshops
- Add workshop selection UI
- Implement workshop isolation in WebSocket connections
- Create workshop management API endpoints

### Phase 2: Enhanced Control
**Goal**: Professional workshop management tools

**Features:**
- Workshop scheduling and automatic activation
- Participant invitation system with codes
- Template management for different workshop types
- Advanced permission systems
- Workshop analytics and reporting

**Technical Changes:**
- Scheduled task system for workshop automation
- Invitation/code-based authentication
- Template storage and management system
- Enhanced admin controls and monitoring

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
**Goal**: Platform for educational institutions and large organizations

**Features:**
- Cross-workshop collaboration tools
- Mentorship and peer review systems
- Portfolio creation from multiple workshop projects
- Integration with learning management systems
- Advanced analytics and progress tracking

**Technical Changes:**
- Cross-workshop data sharing mechanisms
- Portfolio generation and export
- External system integrations
- Advanced analytics infrastructure

## Benefits of This Approach

### For Educators
- **Semester management**: Organize multiple classes and sessions
- **Progress tracking**: See student development across workshops
- **Resource reuse**: Templates and materials across courses
- **Assessment tools**: Export and grade student work

### For Organizations
- **Scalable training**: Run workshops for different departments
- **Skill development**: Progressive workshop series
- **Team building**: Collaborative projects across teams
- **Cost management**: Detailed tracking per department/event

### For Communities
- **Event management**: Multiple tracks and skill levels
- **Knowledge sharing**: Experienced participants help newcomers
- **Portfolio building**: Showcase work from multiple events
- **Community growth**: Attract participants with diverse offerings

## Current System Constraints

### Technical Limitations
- Single active workshop assumption throughout codebase
- Authentication tied to active workshop concept
- WebSocket connections don't support workshop context switching
- Admin tools assume single workshop context

### Data Model Considerations
- Workshop model exists but underutilized
- User-workshop relationship is 1:1 (should be many:many for mentors)
- No workshop template or scheduling mechanisms
- Cost tracking per workshop needs enhancement

## Next Steps

1. **Analyze current codebase** for single-workshop assumptions
2. **Design multi-workshop authentication** flow
3. **Create workshop management API** endpoints
4. **Build workshop discovery interface**
5. **Implement workshop isolation** in WebSocket connections
6. **Add workshop creation/archiving** functionality

This roadmap transforms the system from a single-event tool into a comprehensive platform suitable for educational institutions, corporate training programs, and community events.
